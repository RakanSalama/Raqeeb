### Real-Time Monitoring
Managers can access these cameras integrated into the system to view the environment and ensure everything is running smoothly.

### Data Storage and Management
All captured activities are securely stored in a SQL Server Express database, providing efficient data retrieval for quick and reliable access to stored information.

## System Architecture
The system architecture integrates multiple components to provide comprehensive monitoring and analysis. Inputs are captured via high-quality cameras and video feeds, which are processed using OpenCV for computer vision and YOLOv8 for image analysis through machine learning techniques. The processed data and analyzed videos are then managed and stored in a secure SQL Server Express database. The Python programming language is utilized for data processing tasks. Data storage is seamlessly integrated with Power BI, a data visualization tool, to create interactive dashboards and detailed reports. Authorized users, such as stakeholders and managers, can access these insights through a React web application or receive automated email reports. Additionally, robotic process automation (RPA) tools enhance the system by automating repetitive tasks, ensuring efficient and real-time data management and visualization.
